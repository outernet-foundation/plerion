I solved this by:

1. Installing MessagePack itself using NugetForUnity,
2. Importing the MessagePack .unityPackage from this release:
   https://github.com/MessagePack-CSharp/MessagePack-CSharp/releases/tag/v2.5.140
3. Moving the Assets/Scripts/MessagePack/Unity folder from the imported package to this folder (and renaming it to MessagePack)
4. Deleting everything else imported by step 2
5. Add "#nullable enable" to the top of Formatters.cs and UnityResolver.cs (to eliminate some warnings):
